# -Health-Care--Dashboard-Data-Analyst-Project
I have developed an Healthcare Analytics Project using Python and Power BI, where I solved multiple analytical questions in Python with the help of Pandas Library and created an interactive visualization dashboard in Power BI.

# Project Overview :
My project explores Hospital data with the help of Python and Power BI , where I explored patterns , Finances & Medications 
My main was to clean the data , check for patters and create an interactive dashboard to make it easy read , understand and present

# Tools Used :
Python(Pandas and Matplotlib)
Microsoft Excel 
Power BI

# About Dataset :
Data Source : Healthcare Dataset (Prasad Patil, Kaggle) | 55K Rows, 15 Columns
